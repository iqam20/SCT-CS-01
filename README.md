# Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption

This project is a simple Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm.  
It allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** text messages by providing a shift value.  

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest forms of encryption, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Encrypts text with a user-defined shift value  
- Decrypts text back to its original form  
- Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters  
- Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged  

---

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works
- Each letter in the text is shifted forward (encryption) or backward (decryption) by the shift value.  
- Example:  
  - Message: `HELLO`  
  - Shift: `3`  
  - Encrypted: `KHOOR`  
  - Decrypted: `HELLO`
